      "Review #3: Let's all raise our glasses and pour a little out for the legacy of Chef and Owner of Butterfly Restaurant, Robert Lam whose creations have pushed the East-West fusion culinary boundaries for almost fifteen years now at this location on Pier 33 as well as Butterfly's original location in the Mission. As they say all good things must come to an end and Chef Lam's importance to the culinary landscape of San Francisco should never be ignored. When I found out that Chef Lam announced the closure of Butterfly just this past week on Saturday January 7th noting that their lease is up and it's time to move on. But I couldn't move on after so many previous visits and neither could my friend Christine, who insisted we go to Butterfly on their final night and celebrate the good food, affordable prices and sexy ambiance that it has been offering tourists and locals alike at this location for what in terms of San Francisco restaurants livelihoods seems like forever. \n",
      "\n",
      "There was so much good food on the menu and our server Tom and the entire crew at Butterfly treated us like we were enjoying a fond goodbye party for an old friend. Our group which including Christine's son weren't super hungry but we knew we had to go with their signature dish, Wok Seared Shanghai Noodles with minced scallions and toasted garlic. At 12 dollars it was a decent price and cooked so well without a lot of oil but with a lot of garlic, red and green peppers and onions. We also went with the Duck Confit Spring Rolls at 10 dollars were solid but were actually more Chinese inspired than they were Vietnamese and a little dry for my taste so thank goodness there was black scallion soy sauce for dipping or we would have been very disappointed. \n",
      "\n",
      "But that was just a sampler, as we decided to get a main course dish as well (disproving that we weren't hungry) as the smells from the open kitchen from Chef Lam were just too enticing to pass up another dish so we went with the perfect dish for two, the Teriyaki Grilled Hangar Steak served with Gratin Potato, Brussels Sprouts, and Portobello Jus de Veau. It was cooked to perfection eith a little medium heat and seasoned well, and the I loved Chef Lam's version of Potato Gratin as it was heavy without being too dense. Ironically we were just going to eat light with some chicken wings for our third dish, but our server Tom said they were all out on their final day so I guess this was a blessing disguise that we went with a main dish and something as deliciously and meticulously prepared as that hangar steak.

      "But seriously we were here to celebrate the work that Chef Robert Lam put into making Butterfly Restaurant not only survive but thrive at Pier 33 on the Embarcadero for over a decade and a half! He is one serious cook who knows how to adapt his Asian-inspired menu to make sure it appeals to large celebratory crowd that Butterfly has become famous for. From the gorgeous views of the bay to exotic sea urchin inspired light fixtures, (which are smartly going somewhere with Chef Lam and his team) I am sure going to miss this place. Butterfly may not be finest of dining spots on this busy San Francisco promenade, but the food is good enough to hold its own against any restaurant in a similar mid-range price point.
